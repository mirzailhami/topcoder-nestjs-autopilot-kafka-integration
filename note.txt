Implemented Kafka integration with producer, consumers (unique groupIds: autopilot-phase-group, autopilot-challenge-group, autopilot-command-group), retries, and graceful shutdown.
Added schema validation for autopilot.phase.transition, autopilot.challenge.update, and autopilot.command.
Fixed infinite loop by skipping auto_pilot originator messages, validated date field, and resolved Kafka health check issue by adjusting timeouts and test command.
Implemented ConfigService with Joi validation, mock AuthService for token retrieval, and HealthService for /health endpoint.
Tested all topics with Offset Explorer (localhost:9093) and verified health endpoint (http://localhost:3000/health).
